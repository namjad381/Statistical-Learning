# Statistical-Learning
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Dataset is available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist.
This project aims to build a simple Machine learning algorithm to unravel the image classification tasks. Moreover, we utilized CNN to compare the performance of Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and Stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
